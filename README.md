# Customer-Churn
Figuring out customer churn for Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA
Quiz: 
Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA. They're keen on determining how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things. So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn, how would you use machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave? What steps would you take to create a machine-learning model to predict whether someone will leave?

Answer:
When consumers or subscribers of a company, product, or service decide to no longer engage with that entity, this is known as customer churn, attrition, or turnover. Sprint is notably affected by "customer churn," when customers cease paying for and utilizing a company's goods or services. Companies may lose money and opportunity due to client churn. Retaining current customers is usually more cost-effective than obtaining new ones, making customer retention a crucial measure for businesses to monitor and manage. Customers may leave for various reasons, such as better deals elsewhere, unhappiness, price sensitivity, the end of a contract, or disinterest. Businesses, especially telecom firms like Sprint, place a premium on predicting and minimizing customer turnover, and they often use data analytics and machine learning models to identify likely churners and conduct proactive retention tactics.

Data Importation and Exploration
Importing data into the Python environment is the first step in building a machine-learning model to forecast customer attrition accurately. Importing historical data into Python is the cornerstone of building a churn prediction model. Libraries like pandas, well-known for their speed in loading and early exploration of datasets, are often used for this purpose. Customer demographics, use habits, contract specifications, and churn statistics over time should all be included in the dataset. In particular, before digging further into the modeling process, it is crucial to understand the structure of the dataset and the variety of characteristics available. In this stage, exploring the data is crucial. It comprises looking for anomalies, missing numbers, and other indicators of poor data quality. Using pandas methods like head() and description(), you may get a feel for the dataset's features and see where you could run into problems during data preparation.
Data Preprocessing 
To ensure the dataset is ready for machine learning tasks, the following stage is data preparation, which links data imports and model building. It includes several necessary responsibilities, such as dealing with missing data. It's crucial to look for and fill in any gaps in data. Imputation (filling in missing values) and eliminating rows/columns with too many blanks are two methods used to address this problem. Categorical variables will also need to be encoded at this stage. Categorical variables must be converted into a numerical representation for machine learning models. Accurate representation of categorical characteristics is achieved using tried-and-true methods like one-hot encoding. Scaling numerical characteristics is also an important step at this stage. Scaling or standardizing numerical characteristics is essential to guarantee they contribute proportionally to the model. This stage prevents high-dimensional characteristics from taking over the training phase.
Data Splitting and Model Selection
The next step entails separating the information. Creating a separate testing set from the training set is essential for accurate model assessment. Most of the data is used for training the model, and just a tiny percentage is used for testing. Using this partitioning method, the model may learn from a small sample of the data while its predicted ability is rigorously tested on new data. The effectiveness of the churn prediction model is heavily dependent on selecting an appropriate machine learning algorithm. Logistic regression will be used since the resulting model is intuitive and can be easily communicated to project participants. In customer churn datasets, it is customary to include numerical and categorical information, which the model handles well. Logistic regression is a good option since it focuses on the value of each variable in isolation when attempting to forecast churn. Sprint may use the report's coefficients to determine which features are most responsible for customer retention or defection.

Training and Testing Model
Once the method is established, the training dataset is used to fine-tune the model. To train an algorithm, one must first provide it with feature data (X_train) and labels (y_train). The model can confidently predict new data because of what it has learned from the training data. After a model has been trained, it must be assessed using relevant metrics. Accuracy, a measure of the proportion of correct predictions, is a popular evaluator in churn prediction. Accuracy is how often a forecast turns out to be correct compared to the total number of optimistic predictions. Recall, which measures the percentage of true positives correctly detected, may also be used in model assessment. These metrics provide essential information about the model's churn prediction accuracy and false positive and negative rates.

The Use, Maintenance, and Revision of Models
After development, the high-quality model will be deployed in real life. With this implementation, Sprint may use the algorithm to predict churn in real-time and avoid customer loss. Customers' preferences and behaviors may evolve. It's essential to assess the model's performance regularly. Regular updates may make the model more helpful. The model must be retrained with new information and supplemented with others to increase its prediction power and accommodate changing consumer preferences.
